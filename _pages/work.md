<div class="post">

In 2008, I co-founded my own web development agency: [Tilt Studio](https://www.tilt-studio.fr).

> We build hand crafted web sites. We work with clients on maintaining their sites and coding their commercial operations. We code responsive and interactive emails. And we also provide code audits and HTML emails workshops. Overall, we care about accessibility and web performance.
> 
> We’re a **small team** of four people, and we intend to keep it that way. We can focus on doing what we want to do: web and email development.
> 
> We’re **the ones who code**. The people you talk to are the people who work on your project. When you have a question, we know what we are talking about.
> 
> We’re working at the office or at home, monday to friday, from 9am to 6pm. **We respect those hours**, for us, for our employees, but also for our closed ones.
