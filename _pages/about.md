<div class="post">

I am a french web and email developer based on the north of France, near Lille. I work at my own small web development agency, <a href="https://www.tilt-studio.fr">Tilt Studio</a>, since 2008. I love to learn new things and teach them afterwards.

In 2010, I started a Twitter account under the nickname _HTeuMeuLeu_ (childish slang for _HTML_) and also opened [a blog in french](https://www.hteumeuleu.fr). I made this image about [how designers, developers and project managers see each others](https://www.hteumeuleu.fr/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/developpeurs-graphistes-chefs-projets.jpg).

In 2013, I gave [my first talk about HTML emails](https://speakerdeck.com/hteumeuleu/lintegration-de-mails-responsive). I realized I liked it a lot, so I kept digging on the subject of HTML emails ever since.
