Hi! My name is Rémi Parmentier and I am a French front-end developer working at my own small web development agency, <a href="https://www.tilt-studio.fr">Tilt Studio</a>. I love to learn, and enjoy even more to teach.

This led me on a joyful quest to understand and demistify HTML emails coding. I run workshops, give talks and write articles on my blog to help others code better HTML emails.
