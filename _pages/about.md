<div class="post">

<p>I am a french web and email developer based on the north of France, near Lille. I work at my own small web development agency, <a href="https://www.tilt-studio.fr">Tilt Studio</a>, since 2008. I love to learn new things and teach them afterwards.</p>

<p>In 2010, I started a Twitter account under the nickname <em>HTeuMeuLeu</em> (childish slang for _HTML_) and also opened <a href="https://www.hteumeuleu.fr">a blog in french</a>. I made this image about <a href="https://www.hteumeuleu.fr/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/developpeurs-graphistes-chefs-projets.jpg">how designers, developers and project managers see each others</a>.</p>

<p>In 2013, I gave <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/hteumeuleu/lintegration-de-mails-responsive">my first talk about HTML emails</a>. I realized I liked it a lot, so I kept digging on the subject of HTML emails ever since.</p>
