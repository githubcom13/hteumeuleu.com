<p id="fdf9">When I started working on <a href="https://www.caniemail.com" rel="noopener">Can I email</a>, I faced an interesting problem very early on. How will I organize email clients?</p>
<p id="91d3">The biggest reference at that time, <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/style-element/style-in-head/" rel="noopener">Campaign Monitor’s CSS Guide</a>, divided clients into three groups: <strong>Desktop</strong>, <strong>Mobile</strong> and <strong>Webmail</strong>. But I always found that confusing because a webmail could either be a desktop webmail (like Gmail’s), a mobile webmail (again, like Gmail’s) or both (like Outlook.com). Then, Campaign Monitor listed clients by alphabetical order. This seemed like a logical solution. But it revealed to be a frustrating one to use. I always had to scroll through email clients I didn’t really care about (like <em>AOL Alto</em> or <em>IBM Notes 9</em>) before diving into the good stuff (<em>Gmail</em>, <em>Outlook</em>, <em>Yahoo!</em>).</p>

<p id="4a87">In our day to day life, when we talk about email clients, we often refer to them as just “Outlook” or “Gmail”. “<em>The email is broken in Outlook.</em>” (Of course it is.) “<em>Can you fix this in Gmail?</em>” (It depends. <a href="https://emails.hteumeuleu.com/trying-to-make-sense-of-gmail-css-support-2019-edition-b7cc132ee226" rel="noopener">Which Gmail?</a>) This is just a language abuse, only there to accomodate our hectic pace of life.</p>
<p id="5b56">So in the early days of developing Can I Email, I had this amazing idea (or at least so I thought) to transcribe our daily language into the display of support results. Each feature page would have a big summary block on top stating the name of an “<em>email client</em>” (Outlook, Gmail, Apple Mail, …) and then the according support status for that feature across its different “<em>versions</em>” (Windows, macOS, Outlook.com, …).</p>
<figure id="3d67"><img width="1320" height="830" src="/uploads/2020/05/caniemail-prototype-2019.png"><figcaption>Early prototype for a feature support page of Can I Email as of march 2019.</figcaption></figure>
<p id="a7e3">But the more I used the site while in development, the more I realized this simplification didn’t work well. It took a huge amount of space and required scrolling to get to the good stuff. Plus, it felt wrong. What does it mean for something to be “Supported” in Outlook?</p>
<p id="1150">Because you see, Outlook is not an email client. It is a brand name. A group of different email clients. You’ve got Outlook on Windows, Outlook on macOS, Outlook on iOS, Outlook on Android and Outlook.com on the web.</p>
<p id="5b9b">Same goes for Gmail. You’ve got Gmail desktop webmail, Gmail mobile webmail, Gmail iOS app, Gmail Android app, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm.lite" rel="noopener">Gmail Go</a>, and all sorts of legacy Gmail versions on the web.</p>
<p id="21ee">For Can I email, I ended calling this <em>a family</em>. Outlook is <em>a family</em> of email clients. Each client is available on <em>a platform</em>: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, desktop webmail, mobile webmail, etc. And each one of these has different <em>versions</em>. For example, Outlook on Windows has versions 2019, 2016, 2013, and so on. (Which are actually commercial versions names, not software versions numbers, but let’s save this for another article.)</p>
<p id="d47f">A few weeks ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/caniemail/status/1243844431758987264" rel="noopener">I noticed</a> something funny on <a href="https://www.caniemail.com/scoreboard/" rel="noopener">Can I email’s scoreboard</a> (which keeps count of how many features every email clients’ latest version support). For a few weeks, <strong>Outlook was both the best and worst email client</strong> ranked in our scoreboard.</p>
<p id="2972">Of course, that sentence only makes sense if you’re Erwin Schrödinger or if you use imprecise language.</p>
<figure id="5007"><img width="1200" height="789" src="/uploads/2020/05/caniemail-scoreboard.png"><figcaption>Can I email’s scoreboard showing Outlook both at its best (on macOS) and its worst (on Windows).</figcaption></figure>
<p id="5661">So if you’re writing a brief for an agency about which email clients you want to be supported, or if you’re making feedback to your email developer, or if you’re developing email clients related software: make sure to always state a client’s full name, with its family, its platform and its version.</p>
