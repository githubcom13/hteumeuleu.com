<h2 id="faf3">How Gmail came to stop supporting CSS animations</h2>
<p id="3691">Did you know that not so long ago, Gmail supported CSS animations? Well, sort of. Up until June 2016, the desktop webmail of Gmail supported CSS <code>@keyframes</code> declarations. So you could declare the following animation in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your email, and Gmail would keep it intact.</p>

<pre id="5d28"><code>@keyframes <strong>foo</strong> {<br> from { background:red; }<br> to { background:black; }<br>}</code></pre>

<p id="6c7b">The problem is that, in itself, such a declaration is useless. In order to call an animation in CSS, you need the actual <code>animation</code> CSS property.</p>

<pre id="8df8"><code>&lt;div style=&quot;animation:<strong>foo</strong> linear 1s;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

<p id="bfa3">But Gmail didn’t support the <code>animation</code> property. So that was all pretty pointless. I shared <a href="https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=keyframes%20from%3Ahteumeuleu&amp;src=typd" rel="noopener">my frustration a few times on Twitter</a>, without thinking too much about it.</p>

<p id="8eb1">Later that year, in may of 2016, I was fiddling around in Gmail <a href="https://emails.hteumeuleu.com/trying-to-make-sense-of-gmail-css-support-e88cd7995cea" rel="noopener">trying to make sense of its CSS support</a>. And I realized that instead of being pointless, the <code>@keyframes</code> support could be a real security issue.</p>

<p id="36c2">Because Gmail was not just supporting CSS <code>@keyframes</code> declarations. It was keeping the name of the declaration <em>intact</em>. This meant that, theoretically, you could override any CSS animation that the webmail used. And while Gmail is pretty sober in terms of visible animations, it still uses quite a few.</p>
<p id="2031">I wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/hteumeuleu/89e93c95b08bf85e72a2fa59b936fd33" rel="noopener">a small script</a> to get all the elements that have an <code>animation</code> style, and got a dozen of result. Those animations were referencing about as much <code>@keyframes</code> declarations. Most of these animations were only called during very specific actions in the interface of Gmail, outside of an email view. But one of them, named <code>gb__a</code>, was quite interesting.</p>

<pre id="e7ab"><code>@keyframes gb__a {<br> 0%  { opacity:0 }<br> 50% { opacity:1 }<br>}</code></pre>

<p id="c7c8">This animation uses the <code>opacity</code> property to create a fading effect. It is used in the upper right hand corner of Gmail when you open the little pop ups with your app, your notifications or your account information.</p>

</figure>
<p id="a3d0">This was perfect! This meant that for the split moment this animation was playing, I could apply any styles that Gmail allowed. I could change the width and height of that element, change its background color, and apply a background image to display some content.</p>
<p id="94f6">At that moment, I knew that what I found was pretty serious. Having read other stories of email security like <a href="http://freshinbox.com/blog/how-i-helped-make-office-365-a-little-safer/" rel="noopener">this one by Justin Khoo</a>, I was definitely willing to report this. Turns out Google has a handy and memorable URL to report vulnerabilities: <a href="http://goo.gl/vulnz" rel="noopener">goo.gl/vulnz</a>. After reading tips from Google to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/improve" rel="noopener">write a good bug report</a> (and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/nonvuln" rel="noopener">what doesn’t qualify as a bug</a>), I <a href="https://gist.github.com/hteumeuleu/87a0d296648bea3488416f2ad04b9f31#file-gmail-animation-hack" rel="noopener">made a prototype of an email</a> to show how the vulnerability could be exploited. I imitated Google’s email design to make a somewhat convincing notification email inviting a recipient to click on the top right hand icons.</p>

<p id="78bd">And if you clicked on any of the top right icons, here’s what you would see.</p>

<p id="eeb6">I reported this on May 20, 2016, and immediately received an automated response. Three days later, I got a personal response from a Google employee that they were looking into it. Two days after, I received another personal response asking me to send the test email to a specific address.</p>
<p id="a64f">And then, on June 7, I received the following email:</p>

<blockquote id="08a2">Hello,

Thank you for reporting this bug. As part of Google’s Vulnerability Reward Program, the panel has decided to issue a reward of $1337.

[…]

Regards,<br>Google Security Bot</blockquote>

<p id="d7e2">That was such a pleasant surprise. This is still to this day probably one of my proudest email geek achievement.</p>

<p id="ad66">A few days later, Gmail started filtering all <code>@keyframes</code> declarations. And that’s how Gmail came to stop supporting CSS animations.</p>

<hr />

<p id="4de5">I wanted to tell this story two years after because I think it’s still a good example how important security is in the email world.</p>

<ul>
	<li id="3766">Google is taking Gmail security very seriously. This is visible at multiple levels, from their <a href="https://goo.gl/vulnz" rel="noopener">memorable report URL</a> to their financial reward. My experience with Google has been in huge contrast to <a href="https://emails.hteumeuleu.com/thinking-outside-the-table-at-tedc16-a58a76c7c625#0f95" rel="noopener">one of my previous experience</a> with another email client where I was almost laughed at for much more serious issues. If you’re an email client maker, you should <em>want</em> the good guys (and girls) to report an issue. So you should make everything in your power to make reporting bugs easy and attractive so that people <em>want</em> to take some of their time to report you an issue.</li>
	<li id="18c6">In a webmail, a lot of CSS features can become vulnerabilities. There’s a good chance that CSS <code>@keyframes</code> didn’t even exist at the time Gmail’s parser was written. This doesn’t mean that <code>@keyframes</code> and <code>animation</code> can’t be supported safely in a webmail. But a webmail should always be cautious about what they support. Thus, a restrictive black list (that only allows a subset of styles) is still the best way to go. We might never see the same level of support of CSS in emails than on the Web, and it’s probably a good thing.</li>
