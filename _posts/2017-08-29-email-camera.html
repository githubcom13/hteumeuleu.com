Here’s a transcript of my lightning talk.</p>

<p id="9b9d">I really like video games. I am a big fan of Nintendo and especially of the Game Boy. I <em>love</em> the Game Boy. It was my first console when I was a child. And now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gameboy/comments/3p7kyf/heres_my_collection/" rel="noopener">I love to collect them</a>.</p>

<p id="8a9d">In 1998, Nintendo released the Game Boy Camera. It was a cartridge mounted with a digital camera. It could take pictures in four levels of grey with a resolution of 128 × 112 pixels. And it came complete with games, filters, and was compatible with the Game Boy Printer. The Game Boy Camera turned any Game Boy into the ultimate selfie machine.</p>
<p id="075c">Earlier this year, I was on the <a href="https://email.geeks.chat/" rel="noopener">#emailgeeks Slack</a>. And at some point, <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinmandeville" rel="noopener">Kevin Mandeville</a> mentioned the Game Boy Camera. And <a href="https://twitter.com/iamacyborg" rel="noopener">Jacques Corby-Tuech</a> replied something along the lines: “<em>Game Boy Camera in email</em>”.</p>
<p id="c2e0">This hit me immediately. I <em>had</em> to do this. If someone should come up with a Game Boy camera inspired email, that had to be me. Plus, I already had the feeling that using the camera within an email should be something possible ever since I saw <a href="https://codepen.io/noahblon/pen/ZbjmbK" rel="noopener">this demo on CodePen</a>.</p>

<p id="c016">It’s a dynamic image colorizing demo that uses the system color picker and lets you change the color of a car in a picture. And it doesn’t use any JavaScript. This is just raw HTML and CSS. And it’s possible thanks to the following element.</p>
<pre id="5af3"><code>&lt;input type=&quot;color&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
<p id="170e">What’s great about color input types in HTML is that it uses your system color picker. And browsers usually give you a small preview of the color chosen.</p>

<p id="6581">Using a little bit of CSS and proprietary pseudo selectors like <code>::-webkit-color-swatch</code> and <code>::-webkit-color-swatch-wrapper</code>, we can remove borders and paddings around the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>. Then using a bit more styles, we can size this input full screen. And then we can place the image below it. And using the CSS <code>mix-blend-mode:hue;</code> property, we can achieve the desired effect.</p>
<p id="a29a">What has any of this to do with emails and the Game Boy Camera?</p>
<p id="ee02">Well, turns out we can achieve something quite similar using the following element.</p>
<pre id="1133"><code>&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
<p id="27bb">A file input lets you upload files on the Web. And there are two things especially great about it:</p>
<ol>
	<li id="9fc3">On iOS or Android, you can import a file from you device, or use your camera to take a photo right here from the input file.</li>
	<li id="7ad7">On iOS, you get a little 18 × 18px image thumbnail of the photo you just took.</li>
</ol>

</figure>

<p id="b4a3">So again, using CSS and proprietary selectors like <code>::-webkit-file-upload-button</code>, we can hide the default “<em>Choose file</em>” button, crop the input to show only the image, and use a CSS transform to make it much bigger.</p>

<p id="368e">Later that day, on Slack, I posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1ltAgkuIX4" rel="noopener">the following video</a>.</p>

<p id="fe7d">Here’s <a href="https://codepen.io/hteumeuleu/pen/xLyOPE" rel="noopener">the whole demo on CodePen</a>. It works great on Apple Mail in iOS. Try it for yourself and have fun!</p>
