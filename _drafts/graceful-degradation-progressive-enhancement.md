title:  "Graceful degradation versus Progressive Enhancement"

An escalator versus a stairlift.

An escalator can work when the power is off. It's not a very good stairs, but it still work. It degrades gracefully.

A stairlift is an add-on to regular stairs. The stairs work fine without it. But the stairlift can make the experience better for those who need it. It progressively enhances the stairs.

Using `border-radius`:

* To make a round cornered button. The button still works fine without the round corners. `border-radius` simply makes it better for those who have it. It's progressive enhancement.
* To make a full circle container. The container still works without the round corners. But it's not a very good looking one. It degrades gracefully.
