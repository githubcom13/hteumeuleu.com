title:  "Introducing Email Platform Status"

A year ago, [Can I email was launched](/2019/introducing-caniemail-com/). Today, I am pleased to announce that my team at Tilt Studio is launching [Email Platform Status](https://www.emailplatformstatus.com/).

Inspired by [Chrome Platform Status](https://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/css/popularity), Email Platform Status tells you what HTML and CSS properties email developers use.

We use [Really Good Emails](https://www.reallygoodemails.com/)â€™ incredible emails collection to parse the code and gather the data. The result is a first of its kind look into how email developers actually code.

Can I email gives email developers data about what email clients support.
Email Platform Status gives email clients makers data about what email developers use.

I feel like Email Platform Status is the missing link to pave the way for standards in the industry.
