title:  "Email Developer is a Job"

There’s a popular saying in the email community: 

> You don’t choose email. Email chooses you.

Nobody dreams of coding emails. You usually get into development because you want to code video games, personalize your website or create a fun mobile app. Not really because you want to send a newsletter.
